# Thomas Fire Investigation

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis focusing on air quality and the impact of wildfires in the Santa Barbara region. Utilizing a combination of air quality index (AQI) data and satellite imagery, the project aims to provide insights into the environmental changes and challenges faced by this area, particularly in relation to air pollution and wildfire events.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to:
1. Analyze Air Quality Trends: Examine AQI data from 2017 and 2018 to identify patterns, trends, and any significant changes in air quality over time in Santa Barbara County.
2. Assess Wildfire Impact: Utilize Landsat 8 satellite imagery to create true and false-color images of the region, highlighting areas affected by the 2017 Thomas Fire. This analysis seeks to understand the spatial extent of the fire and its impact on the local environment.

## Data
